            <p>In the daytime it’s busy and in a rush, but at night the city really comes to life. The bright lights from time square bands blasting music and just the night vibe. It really comes out at night. <p>
            
            <h1>2. Landmarks </h1>
           
            <p> Going to some cool like crossing the Brooklyn bridge or having a picnic at central park. I would love to go to broadway it would be so fun I think the energy would be amazing.</p>
